# web-dev-starter

This is a review project covering writing HTML from scratch without 
the help of Google, AI, or other internet sources.

## Getting Started

All that is needed to get started is to clone this repository.

## Development

If using VSCode, install the Live Server extension. This will allow you to view the changes to your code and
project in real-time when running the ">Live Preview: Start Server" command in VSCode. This will open up a
separate window displaying your webpage in real-time as you work on the project. 

To see how your designed webpage will look in an actual browser, you can simply copy the web address from
the opened window and paste it into your browser's search bar. This will display the full webpage and will
also update in real-time as you work on the project. 

## Testing

No test class was used for this project. To test if the webpage itself works, use the Live Server extension
to start the server using the command ">Live Preview: Start Server". Once started, a preview window will
appear displaying the webpage. You can copy the web address and paste it into your browser to see the full
display of the webpage.
